# React-Native-POC
Using React Native create an Android app that determines the reachability of a host. For the sake this test, let's pretend there is no way to test reachability with any built in React Native functionality or from within the JS environment. So, we'll need to create a native Android module using Java that will check reachability for us.

Instructions

1. Use the provided assets and wireframe to create the UI in React Native.

2. When the user enters a host in the text input box and presses the "Test" button the app should check whether or not the supplied host is reachable.

3. The image on the left, under the text input box, should display a grey, green, or red dot for "unchecked', "successfully reached", or "failed to reach" respectively.
